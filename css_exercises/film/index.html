       Monty Python's Life of Brian, also known as Life of Brian,
       is a 1979 British comedy film starring and written by the
       comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam,
       Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin). It was directed by Jones.
       The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman),

       next door to—Jesus, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.
